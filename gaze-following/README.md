# gaze-following

The gaze follow script in this folder is based on the original paper "Where are they looking" by A. Recasens, A. Khosla, C.Vondrick and A. Torralba - Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2015. 

This script runs in Python 2.7 and 3.x and requires the weights from the original implementation, that can be downloaded [here](http://gazefollow.csail.mit.edu). 
It is based on the original implementation in Matlab.
